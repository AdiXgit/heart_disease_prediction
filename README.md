# heart_disease_prediction

Hey guys the project deals with predicitng the heart disease using logistic regression.

I have used GridSearchCV cause it helps find the best combination of hyperparameters for a model.
I used the UCL machine learning repository to extract the dataset for  my project.

It was great working on this project , looking forward for more such projects
