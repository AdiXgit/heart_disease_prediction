# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease using logistic regression.

## Overview

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCL Machine Learning Repository.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.
- **Model Training**: Training a logistic regression model to predict heart disease.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the model.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCL Machine Learning Repository. It contains various health parameters that are used to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AdiXgit/heart_disease_prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd heart_disease_prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb to see the results.
Results
The logistic regression model predicts the likelihood of heart disease with a certain degree of accuracy. The hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV helps in improving the model's performance.
